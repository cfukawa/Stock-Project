# Stock Project
 
Hello, welcome to my Stock Project. This is a part of the final project for CS 4650.

This is a month long project about buying and selling stocks using [Investopedia's Stock Market Simulator](https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/)

The project is broken down into 4 weeks of analysis. Each week has its own Jupyter Notebook that shows and explains what buys and sales we made.

[Week 1](../Week 1/Week 1.ipynb)
[Week 2](Week 2)
[Week 3](Week 3)
[Week 4](Week 4)

Some of the tools that we used throughout the project include:

1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for storing and manipulating data using data frames
2. [slickcharts](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500) for data about the S&P 500
3. [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) for getting data about stocks from Yahoo Finance
